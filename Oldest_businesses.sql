   Q1. What is the oldest business on each continent?
   - Join businesses with countries to get continent info.
   - For each continent, find the business with the earliest 
     year_founded using MIN().
   - Return business name, founding year, country, and continent.

   Q2. How many countries per continent lack data on the oldest 
       businesses? 
   - Check if any countries have no businesses recorded.
   - Extend analysis by including `new_businesses` data with UNION.
   - Count how many such countries exist per continent.

   Q3. Which business categories are best suited to last over 
       the course of centuries? 
   - Join businesses with categories and countries.
   - For each continentâ€“category pair, find the earliest 
     year_founded.
   - Helps identify industries with the longest-lasting businesses.
